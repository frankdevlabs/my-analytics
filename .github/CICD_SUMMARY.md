## Quick Start

### For Testing (Safe)

1. **Create feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/ci-cd-setup
   git add .github/ deployment/scripts/deploy.sh app/src/app/api/health/
   git commit -m "feat: add CI/CD pipeline"
   git push origin feat/ci-cd-setup
   ```

2. **Verify CI runs** on GitHub Actions tab

3. **Test deployment in dry-run**:
   - Go to Actions ‚Üí "CD - Deploy to Production"
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Select branch: `feat/ci-cd-setup`
   - Check "Dry run": ‚úÖ true
   - Click "Run workflow"

4. **Review dry-run logs** to ensure everything looks correct

5. **Merge to main** when ready:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feat/ci-cd-setup
   git push origin main
   ```

## Required GitHub Secrets

Already configured ‚úÖ:
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` - SSH private key for server access
- `SSH_USER` - Username (supergoose)
- `SERVER_IP` - Server IP (95.111.243.79)

---

## Features Implemented

### CI (Continuous Integration)
- ‚úÖ Automated linting on every push/PR
- ‚úÖ Automated testing (non-blocking as requested)
- ‚úÖ Build validation for Next.js + tracker
- ‚úÖ Parallel job execution for speed
- ‚úÖ Next.js cache optimization
- ‚úÖ Coverage report upload

### CD (Continuous Deployment)
- ‚úÖ Automatic deployment on push to main
- ‚úÖ Manual deployment trigger with dry-run option
- ‚úÖ SSH-based deployment to production
- ‚úÖ Database migration support
- ‚úÖ Health check validation (10 retries)
- ‚úÖ Automatic rollback on failure
- ‚úÖ GitHub commit/PR comments with status
- ‚úÖ systemd service verification

### Debugging & Safety
- ‚úÖ Dry-run mode for testing deployment logic
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging (timestamped, colored)
- ‚úÖ Deployment logs saved to `/home/supergoose/my-analytics/deployment.log`
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step error tracking
- ‚úÖ Automatic rollback on health check failure
- ‚úÖ Manual rollback procedures documented

---

## Workflow Triggers

### CI Workflow (ci.yml)
```yaml
Triggers:
  - Push to any branch
  - Pull request to main
  - Manual (workflow_dispatch)

Runs: Always, on all branches
Blocks merge: No (tests are non-blocking)
```

### Deploy Workflow (deploy.yml)
```yaml
Triggers:
  - Push to main (automatic)
  - Manual (workflow_dispatch with dry-run option)

Runs: Only on main branch (or manual on any branch)
Blocks: Prevents concurrent deployments
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Feature Branch Testing
- Create branch: `feat/ci-cd-setup`
- Push files
- CI runs automatically
- Deploy workflow does NOT run (safety)

### Phase 2: Dry-Run Testing
- Manual trigger with dry-run: true
- Reviews deployment steps without executing
- Safe to test deployment logic

### Phase 3: Production Deployment
- Merge to main
- Automatic deployment executes
- Monitors logs and health checks
- Auto-rollback if failure

---

## Expected Performance

### CI Workflow
- **First run**: ~5 minutes (no cache)
- **Cached runs**: ~2-3 minutes
- **Cache hit rate**: 80-90%

### Deployment Workflow
- **Duration**: ~2-3 minutes
- **Steps**:
  - SSH setup: ~5s
  - Code pull: ~5s
  - Dependencies: ~60s (first) / ~20s (cached on server)
  - Migrations: ~5s
  - Build: ~90s
  - Service restart: ~10s
  - Health check: ~5-30s

### Total (Commit ‚Üí Live)
- **Best case**: ~5 minutes
- **Average**: ~6-8 minutes
- **With failures + rollback**: ~10 minutes

---

## Architecture

```
Developer Workflow:
  1. Push code to GitHub
     ‚Üì
  2. CI runs (lint, test, build)
     ‚Üì (if main branch)
  3. Deploy workflow triggers
     ‚Üì
  4. SSH to production server
     ‚Üì
  5. Execute deployment script
     ‚Üì
  6. Pull code, install deps, migrate, build
     ‚Üì
  7. Restart systemd service
     ‚Üì
  8. Health check validation
     ‚Üì (if pass)
  9. ‚úÖ Deployment complete
     ‚Üì (if fail)
  10. üîÑ Auto-rollback to previous version
```

---

## Dependencies Strategy

As discussed, we're using **Option 1**:
- Install ALL dependencies (including devDependencies)
- Allows `npm run build` to work (needs tsx, terser)
- Matches current production behavior
- Simple, reliable, no surprises

**Impact**: +40-60 seconds deployment time (acceptable for reliability)

---

## Debugging Tools

### 1. GitHub Actions Logs
- Full step-by-step output
- Downloadable log archives
- Search functionality

### 2. Server Logs
```bash
# Deployment log
tail -f /home/supergoose/my-analytics/deployment.log

# Service logs
sudo journalctl -u analytics.service -f

# Nginx logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
```

### 3. Health Endpoint
```bash
# Test locally on server
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Test from browser
https://analytics.franksblog.nl/api/health
```

### 4. Dry-Run Mode
```bash
# On server, test deployment manually
cd /home/supergoose/my-analytics
./deployment/scripts/deploy.sh --dry-run --verbose
```

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (First Deployment)
1. ‚úÖ Files created (done)
2. ‚è≥ Create feature branch
3. ‚è≥ Test CI workflow
4. ‚è≥ Test deployment in dry-run mode
5. ‚è≥ Merge to main for production deployment
6. ‚è≥ Verify application works

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

## Security Notes

‚úÖ SSH private key encrypted in GitHub Secrets
‚úÖ No credentials in workflow files
‚úÖ Server .env file never modified by CI/CD
‚úÖ SSH connection uses known_hosts verification
‚úÖ Deployment script runs as non-root user
‚úÖ systemd service isolation maintained

---

## Cost

- **GitHub Actions Free Tier**: 2,000 minutes/month
- **Estimated Usage**: ~110 minutes/month
- **Percentage Used**: ~5.5%
- **Verdict**: ‚úÖ Well within free tier limits

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback
- Triggers on health check failure
- Reverts to previous git commit
- Rebuilds and restarts service
- Logs rollback in deployment.log

### Manual Rollback
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa supergoose@95.111.243.79
cd /home/supergoose/my-analytics
git log --oneline -5
git reset --hard <previous-commit>
cd app && npm install && npm run build
sudo systemctl restart analytics.service
```

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Non-blocking tests**: Tests run but don't fail pipeline (as requested)
2. **Dry-run mode**: Safe testing of deployment logic
3. **Feature branch testing**: Test CI before touching main
4. **All dependencies**: Install devDependencies for reliable builds
5. **Health checks**: 10 retries with 5s intervals for robustness
6. **Auto-rollback**: Safety net for failed deployments
7. **Comprehensive logging**: Debugging is first-class citizen

---

## Success Criteria

After first deployment, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Green checkmark in GitHub Actions
- ‚úÖ Deployment comment on commit
- ‚úÖ Application accessible at https://analytics.franksblog.nl
- ‚úÖ Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- ‚úÖ Tracker script serves correctly
- ‚úÖ No errors in deployment.log
- ‚úÖ systemd service running
