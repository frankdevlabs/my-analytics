## Overview

### What We're Configuring

1. **DNS**: Point domain to server with proxy enabled
2. **SSL/TLS Mode**: Full (strict) encryption
3. **Origin Certificate**: Self-signed certificate for origin server
4. **Authenticated Origin Pulls**: Mutual TLS (mTLS) to verify requests come from Cloudflare
5. **Security Headers**: Already configured in nginx (Cloudflare respects them)
6. **Performance**: Caching, minification, HTTP/2, HTTP/3

### Security Model

```
Client
  ‚Üì (HTTPS - Cloudflare cert)
Cloudflare Edge
  ‚Üì (HTTPS + mTLS - Origin cert)
Your Server (Nginx)
  ‚Üì (HTTP - localhost)
Next.js App
```

## DNS Configuration

### Step 1: Add Domain to Cloudflare

If not already done:

1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Click "Add a Site"
3. Enter your domain: `franksblog.nl`
4. Select plan (Free is sufficient)
5. Click "Add Site"
6. Cloudflare will scan existing DNS records
7. Review and confirm records
8. Click "Continue"

### Step 2: Update Nameservers

Cloudflare will provide two nameservers:

```
ns1.cloudflare.com
ns2.cloudflare.com
```

Or similar (specific to your account).

**At your domain registrar:**
1. Log in to domain registrar
2. Find DNS/Nameserver settings
3. Change nameservers to Cloudflare's nameservers
4. Save changes
5. Wait 24-48 hours for propagation (usually faster)

**Verify nameserver change:**
```bash
dig NS franksblog.nl +short
# Should show Cloudflare nameservers
```

### Step 3: Create A Record

In Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üí DNS ‚Üí Records:

1. Click "Add record"
2. Configure:
   - **Type**: A
   - **Name**: analytics (or your subdomain)
   - **IPv4 address**: YOUR_SERVER_IP
   - **Proxy status**: Proxied (üü† orange cloud) ‚Üê **CRITICAL**
   - **TTL**: Auto
3. Click "Save"

**Example:**
| Type | Name      | Content        | Proxy Status | TTL  |
|------|-----------|----------------|--------------|------|
| A    | analytics | 198.51.100.50  | Proxied (üü†)  | Auto |

**IMPORTANT: Proxy must be enabled (orange cloud)**
- Without proxy, your server IP is exposed
- Authenticated Origin Pulls won't work
- No DDoS protection or caching

**Verify DNS:**
```bash
dig analytics.franksblog.nl +short
# Should return Cloudflare IP (e.g., 104.21.x.x)
# NOT your server IP

ping analytics.franksblog.nl
# Should ping Cloudflare IP, not server IP
```

### Step 4: Add AAAA Record (IPv6) - Optional

If your server has IPv6:

1. Click "Add record"
2. Configure:
   - **Type**: AAAA
   - **Name**: analytics
   - **IPv6 address**: YOUR_IPV6_ADDRESS
   - **Proxy status**: Proxied (üü†)
   - **TTL**: Auto
3. Click "Save"

## SSL/TLS Settings

### Step 1: Set Encryption Mode

Go to SSL/TLS ‚Üí Overview:

1. Select **"Full (strict)"**
2. Do NOT use:
   - ‚ùå Off (no encryption)
   - ‚ùå Flexible (insecure - encrypts only client to Cloudflare)
   - ‚ùå Full (doesn't validate origin certificate)

**Why Full (strict)?**
- Encrypts end-to-end (client ‚Üí Cloudflare ‚Üí server)
- Validates origin certificate against trusted CA
- Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- Required for Authenticated Origin Pulls

### Step 2: Enable Always Use HTTPS

Go to SSL/TLS ‚Üí Edge Certificates:

1. Scroll to "Always Use HTTPS"
2. Toggle **ON**
3. This redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS

**Note:** Nginx also has HTTP ‚Üí HTTPS redirect as backup.

### Step 3: Enable HSTS (Optional but Recommended)

Still in SSL/TLS ‚Üí Edge Certificates:

1. Scroll to "HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)"
2. Click "Enable HSTS"
3. Configure:
   - **Status**: On
   - **Max Age Header**: 6 months (15768000 seconds)
   - **Include subdomains**: On (if all subdomains use HTTPS)
   - **Preload**: On (if you want to submit to HSTS preload list)
4. Click "Save"

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** HSTS preload is permanent and affects all subdomains. Only enable if certain.

### Step 4: Minimum TLS Version

Still in SSL/TLS ‚Üí Edge Certificates:

1. Scroll to "Minimum TLS Version"
2. Select **TLS 1.2** or **TLS 1.3**
3. Matches nginx configuration (TLS 1.2 and 1.3 only)

## Origin Server Certificate

### Step 1: Generate Origin Certificate

Go to SSL/TLS ‚Üí Origin Server:

1. Click "Create Certificate"
2. Configure:
   - **Let Cloudflare generate a private key and a CSR**: Select (default)
   - **Private key type**: RSA (2048) ‚Üê Use this
   - **Certificate Validity**: 15 years (max duration)
   - **Hostnames**:
     ```
     *.franksblog.nl
     franksblog.nl
     ```
     This covers all subdomains + root domain
3. Click "Create"

### Step 2: Save Certificate and Private Key

Cloudflare will show two text boxes:

**Origin Certificate:**
```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIEpjCCA46gAwIBAgIUJmn...
[many lines]
...vHZQqLWs=
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

**Private Key:**
```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEvgIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0...
[many lines]
...Qq0dKXCZA==
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

**Save to local `.env` file:**

Open `/Users/frankdevlab/WebstormProjects/my-analytics/.env` and add:

```env
CLOUDFLARE_ORIGIN_SERVER_CERTIFICATE="-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
[Paste entire certificate here - keep newlines]
-----END CERTIFICATE-----"

CLOUDFLARE_ORIGIN_SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
[Paste entire private key here - keep newlines]
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
```

**CRITICAL SECURITY:**
- Never commit `.env` to git
- Keep private key secret
- These credentials are used by deployment scripts

### Step 3: Click OK

After saving locally:
1. Click "OK" in Cloudflare
2. Certificate is now listed in "Origin Certificates"
3. Expires in 15 years (October 2040)

**Certificate details:**
- Serial number shown
- Status: Active
- Expires: [Date 15 years from now]

**Can't access certificate again** - Cloudflare only shows it once. If lost, create a new certificate and update `.env`.

## Authenticated Origin Pulls

This is the most critical security feature - ensures only Cloudflare can connect to your origin server.

### Step 1: Enable Authenticated Origin Pulls

Still in SSL/TLS ‚Üí Origin Server:

1. Scroll to "Authenticated Origin Pulls"
2. Toggle to **ON**
3. Status should show: "Authenticated Origin Pulls is on"

**What this does:**
- Cloudflare sends a client certificate with every request
- Nginx validates this certificate (configured in nginx config)
- Requests without valid Cloudflare certificate are rejected (400 error)
- Prevents direct attacks on your server IP

### Step 2: Verify in Nginx Config

Your nginx configuration already includes (configured by deployment scripts):

```nginx
# /etc/nginx/sites-available/analytics.franksblog.nl

ssl_client_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/cloudflare/origin-pull-ca.pem;
ssl_verify_client on;
ssl_verify_depth 1;
```

This tells nginx to:
- Require client certificate
- Verify against Cloudflare CA
- Only accept depth 1 (direct signature)

**Cloudflare CA certificate** is downloaded during deployment from:
```
https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/static/authenticated_origin_pull_ca.pem
```

### Step 3: Test Authenticated Origin Pulls

**Test 1: Direct connection should fail**
```bash
# Try connecting directly to server IP (bypassing Cloudflare)
curl -k https://YOUR_SERVER_IP

# Expected result:
# 400 Bad Request
# "No required SSL certificate was sent"
```

This proves mTLS is working - requests without Cloudflare's client certificate are rejected.

**Test 2: Cloudflare proxy should work**
```bash
# Connect through Cloudflare
curl -I https://analytics.franksblog.nl

# Expected result:
# HTTP/2 200 OK
# [Security headers listed]
```

This proves Cloudflare is successfully presenting its client certificate.

**‚ö†Ô∏è If Test 2 returns 400 error:**
- Authenticated Origin Pulls may not be enabled in Cloudflare
- Or nginx config missing Cloudflare CA certificate
- See Troubleshooting section

## Security Settings

### Step 1: Configure Security Level

Go to Security ‚Üí Settings:

1. **Security Level**: Medium (recommended)
   - Low: Only challenges very threatening visitors
   - Medium: Balance between security and user experience
   - High: More aggressive, may challenge legitimate users
   - I'm Under Attack: Maximum protection (use during DDoS)

### Step 2: Enable Bot Fight Mode (Free Plan)

Go to Security ‚Üí Bots:

1. Toggle "Bot Fight Mode" **ON**
2. Challenges/blocks automated traffic
3. Allows good bots (Google, Bing crawlers)

**Note:** Paid plans have more sophisticated bot management.

### Step 3: Configure Challenge Passage

Go to Security ‚Üí Settings:

1. **Challenge Passage**: 30 minutes (default)
   - How long a solved challenge remains valid
   - Shorter = more security, more friction
   - Longer = better UX, less security

### Step 4: Browser Integrity Check

Go to Security ‚Üí Settings:

1. Toggle "Browser Integrity Check" **ON**
2. Blocks common threats from bots
3. Checks for HTTP headers often abused by spammers

## Performance Settings

### Step 1: Enable Auto Minify

Go to Speed ‚Üí Optimization:

1. Scroll to "Auto Minify"
2. Enable:
   - ‚úÖ JavaScript
   - ‚úÖ CSS
   - ‚úÖ HTML
3. Reduces file sizes by removing whitespace/comments

### Step 2: Enable Brotli Compression

Still in Speed ‚Üí Optimization:

1. Toggle "Brotli" **ON**
2. Better compression than gzip (20-30% smaller)
3. Supported by all modern browsers

**Note:** Nginx gzip is still enabled as fallback.

### Step 3: Enable HTTP/2 and HTTP/3

Go to Network:

1. **HTTP/2**: Should be ON (default)
2. **HTTP/3 (with QUIC)**: Toggle **ON**
   - Faster connection establishment
   - Better performance on mobile/unreliable networks
   - Gradually rolling out to browsers

### Step 4: Configure Caching

Go to Caching ‚Üí Configuration:

**Caching Level:**
- Select **Standard** (default)
- Caches static resources
- Respects cache headers from origin

**Browser Cache TTL:**
- Select **4 hours** or **Respect Existing Headers** (recommended)
- Lets nginx control cache duration via headers

**Always Online:**
- Toggle **ON** (optional)
- Serves cached version if origin is down

### Step 5: Page Rules (Optional)

If you want custom caching for specific paths:

Go to Rules ‚Üí Page Rules:

**Example: Cache API responses**
```
URL pattern: analytics.franksblog.nl/api/stats*
Settings:
  - Cache Level: Cache Everything
  - Edge Cache TTL: 5 minutes
```

**Example: Bypass cache for admin**
```
URL pattern: analytics.franksblog.nl/login
Settings:
  - Cache Level: Bypass
```

Free plan allows 3 page rules.

## Verification

### Complete Checklist

After configuration, verify:

**DNS:**
```bash
dig analytics.franksblog.nl +short
# Returns Cloudflare IP (104.x.x.x or 172.x.x.x)

whois analytics.franksblog.nl
# Shows Cloudflare as nameserver
```

**SSL/TLS:**
```bash
curl -I https://analytics.franksblog.nl

# Check for:
# HTTP/2 200
# strict-transport-security header
# x-frame-options header
# (All security headers)
```

**Origin Pulls:**
```bash
# Should fail (no client cert)
curl -k https://YOUR_SERVER_IP
# Expected: 400 Bad Request

# Should succeed (through Cloudflare)
curl -I https://analytics.franksblog.nl
# Expected: 200 OK
```

**Application:**
```bash
# Test application loads
curl https://analytics.franksblog.nl
# Should return HTML

# Test login page
curl https://analytics.franksblog.nl/login
# Should return login page HTML
```

### SSL Labs Test (Optional)

For comprehensive SSL/TLS analysis:

1. Go to https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/
2. Enter: `analytics.franksblog.nl`
3. Click "Submit"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for analysis
5. Expected grade: **A** or **A+**

**Possible issues:**
- If grade lower than A, check:
  - TLS version (should be 1.2+ only)
  - Cipher suites
  - Certificate chain

### Security Headers Test

Check security headers:

1. Go to https://securityheaders.com
2. Enter: `https://analytics.franksblog.nl`
3. Click "Scan"
4. Expected grade: **A** or **A+**

**Headers configured in nginx:**
- Strict-Transport-Security
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Content-Security-Policy
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

### Cloudflare Analytics

Monitor traffic in Cloudflare dashboard:

Go to Analytics & Logs ‚Üí Traffic:
- Requests over time
- Bandwidth usage
- Threats blocked
- Top requests

Initially will show low traffic. Check after few hours of operation.

## Troubleshooting

### DNS Not Resolving to Cloudflare

**Problem:**
```bash
dig analytics.franksblog.nl +short
# Returns server IP instead of Cloudflare IP
```

**Solution:**
1. Check proxy is enabled (orange cloud) in DNS settings
2. If recently changed, wait 5 minutes for propagation
3. Clear local DNS cache: `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache` (macOS) or `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches` (Linux)

### 400 Bad Request After Enabling Origin Pulls

**Problem:** Site shows "400 Bad Request: No required SSL certificate was sent"

**Causes:**
1. Authenticated Origin Pulls enabled in Cloudflare but NOT deployed to nginx yet
2. Cloudflare CA certificate missing on server

**Solution:**
1. If deploying for first time: This is expected until nginx is configured
2. If already deployed: Check nginx config has:
   ```nginx
   ssl_client_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/cloudflare/origin-pull-ca.pem;
   ssl_verify_client on;
   ```
3. Verify CA cert exists:
   ```bash
   ls -la /etc/nginx/ssl/cloudflare/origin-pull-ca.pem
   ```
4. If missing, download:
   ```bash
   sudo curl -o /etc/nginx/ssl/cloudflare/origin-pull-ca.pem \
     https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/static/authenticated_origin_pull_ca.pem
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

### Mixed Content Warnings

**Problem:** Browser console shows mixed content errors

**Cause:** Page loaded over HTTPS references HTTP resources

**Solution:**
1. Ensure all resources use HTTPS or protocol-relative URLs (`//example.com/script.js`)
2. Check Cloudflare ‚Üí SSL/TLS ‚Üí Edge Certificates ‚Üí "Automatic HTTPS Rewrites" is ON

### Certificate Mismatch Errors

**Problem:** Browser shows certificate error

**Causes:**
1. SSL/TLS mode set to "Flexible" or "Off"
2. Origin certificate not installed on server
3. Origin certificate expired

**Solution:**
1. Check SSL/TLS mode is "Full (strict)"
2. Verify origin certificate installed:
   ```bash
   sudo openssl x509 -in /etc/nginx/ssl/analytics.franksblog.nl.pem -text -noout
   ```
3. Check expiration date (should be ~2040)

### Site Not Loading

**Problem:** Site doesn't load or shows Cloudflare error

**Cause:** Origin server not responding

**Solution:**
1. Check server is running:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status analytics.service
   ```
2. Check nginx is running:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status nginx
   ```
3. Check port 3000 is listening:
   ```bash
   sudo lsof -i :3000
   ```
4. Check nginx error logs:
   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
   ```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom SSL Certificates (Not Recommended)

If you want to use Let's Encrypt instead of Cloudflare Origin CA:

**Why not recommended:**
- Cloudflare Origin CA is simpler
- No renewal needed (15 years validity)
- No rate limits

**If you insist:**
1. Disable Authenticated Origin Pulls (less secure)
2. Install certbot on server
3. Get Let's Encrypt certificate
4. Update nginx to use Let's Encrypt cert
5. Configure auto-renewal

Not covered in this guide.

### Per-Hostname Authenticated Origin Pulls

For multiple subdomains with different certificates:

1. Upload custom client certificate in Cloudflare
2. Configure nginx with per-hostname ssl_client_certificate
3. Complex setup - not needed for single subdomain

### Rate Limiting

Cloudflare rate limiting (paid feature):

- Blocks excessive requests from single IP
- Complements nginx rate limiting
- More sophisticated than nginx (global, not per-server)

**Free plan:** Use nginx rate limiting (already configured).
